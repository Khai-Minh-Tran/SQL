# I just finished an amazingly insightful trip to the Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida.
# That sparked an idea: How cool it must have been to go through all the rigorous trainings, obstacles, and challenges in order to become an astronaut?
# Why don't we study and analyze the data of all NASA austronauts in history and pull out some interesting stories?
