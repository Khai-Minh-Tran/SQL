# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle (link below).
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv
# Then, I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed data analytics using SQL.



# Creating my table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)



# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
# Next, it's data exploration time.


#1. What is the average danceability, popularity, and energy by artist (ordered by energy)?
SELECT artist_name,
       avg(danceability),
       avg(popularity),
       avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg(energy) DESC;



#2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name,
       avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 10;



#3. What are the top 10 tracks based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, 
       track_name, 
       popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;



#4. What are the top 5 longest songs (also convert milliseconds to seconds)? 
SELECT artist_name, 
       track_name, 
       (duration_ms/1000) as length_by_second
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY length_by_second DESC
LIMIT 10;



#5. How many songs have acousticness higher and lower than 0.02?
SELECT sum(
         case when acousticness > 0.02
         then 1 else 0 end) AS tracks_higher,
       sum(
         case when acousticness < 0.02
         then 1 else 0 end) AS tracks_lower
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
